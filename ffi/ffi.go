// A ffi.LogMessage represents the text (message) component of a log event.
// A LogMessageView is a LogMessage that is backed by C++ allocated memory
// rather than the Go heap. A LogMessageView, x, is valid when returned and will
// remain valid until a new LogMessageView is returned by the same object (e.g.
// an ir.Deserializer) that returns x.

// event.

// LogEventView memory is allocated and owned by the C++ object (e.g., reader,
// deserializer) that returns it. Reusing a LogEventView after the same object
// has issued a new view leads to undefined behavior, as different objects
// manage their own memory independently.
